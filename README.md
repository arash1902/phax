# PHAX

Physical Characteristics AwareEx-SituTraining Framework for Inverter-Based Memristive Neuromorphic Circuits

This is training framework for an inverter-based memristive neuromorphic hardware. The
framework, which is called PHAX, is a physical characteristics aware one relying on an ex-situ training approach. The considered neuromorphic circuit is highly energy efficient hybrid
CMOS-memristive implementation of neuromorphic circuits.
